# Portfolio

### Long story short
This is my portfolio. It contains assignments and mini-projects I did during my studies that are too small to have their own repositories.

### About me and contents of this repository
My name is Bogna and I studied Artificial Intelligence at the Poznan University of Technology. I am currently doing my Master's degree at the Faculty of Data Processing Technologies. This repository contains some of the work I've done during my studies. It's divided into several directories, each dedicated to a separate course/group of courses I attended. There is also a special directory called "Technologies" which contains some examples of code I've written in certain languages.

It is worth mentioning that some of the files presented here are filled by me assignments, that means that not all the code in these files is mine. It was also written by teachers from PUT who prepared some templates for us to fill during their courses.
